## 1. Setup python project folders
This automation setups a python environment to work with by creating folders and python files including README for github 

### How to?
Firstly create a shell script with a custom command name and save it in `/usr/bin`
```bash
sudo nano /usr/bin/python_proj_directory.sh
```
and inside the `python_proj_directory.sh` paste the code below or write your custom function 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir ./images ./dataset;
touch main.py README.md;
exit;
```
after creating the bash script we need to call a function that works gloabally and runs the bash script 
Usually, the aliases are stored in a hidden file `.zshrc` in the home(~) directory of the user  
Firstly 
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```
paste the code below into the file
```bash
# Custom Aliases
# 1  Creating multiple folders at once for a python project
function cdir(){
/usr/bin/bash python_proj_directory.sh;
}
```

## 2. Scheduling a script

## 3. Creating a custom Service file

### To run the script on system reboot (Ubuntu)
1. Have the python application ready
2. Create a [Service File](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files)
    - The file must have .service extension under /lib/systemd/system/ directory
    - ```bash 
      sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/telegram_bot.service
      ```
    - and add the following content in it. Change Python script filename ad location. Also update the Description.
    - ```bash
      [Unit]
      Description=Dummy Service
      After=multi-user.target
      Conflicts=getty@tty1.service

      [Service]
      Type=simple
      ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/user-directory/path-to-python-script
      StandardInput=tty-force

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```
3. Enable Newly Added Service
    - Your system service has been added to your service. Letâ€™s reload the systemctl daemon to read new file. You need to reload this deamon each time after making any changes         in in .service file.
    - ```bash
      sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      ```
    - Now enable the service to start on system boot, also start the service using the following commands.
    - ```bash
      sudo systemctl enable telegram_bot.service
      sudo systemctl start telegram_bot.service
      ```
    - Finally check the status of your service as following command
    - ```bash
      sudo systemctl status telegram_bot.service
      ```
